#The initialize method:
#Useful when you want to initialize some class variables at the
#time of object creation
#Preceded by def

#The instance variables:
#A kind of class attributes and they become properties of objects
#once the objects are created using the class
#Every object's attributes are assigned individually and share no value
#with other objects.
#They are accessed using the @ operator within the class but to access
#them outside the class we use public methods which are called accessor
#methods.

#The accessor and setter methods:
#to make the variables available fro outside the class they must be defined
#within accessor methods, these accessor methods are also known as getter
#methods.

#Example of class definition, initialize method, accessor & setter methods
