# Instance methods are defined in the same way as anÂ¥ other method using
# the def keyword and they can be used using a class instance
# Their functionality is not limited to access the instance variables

# define a class
class Box
  # constructor method
  def initialize(w,h)
    @width, @height = w, h
  end
  # instance method
  def area
    @width * @height

# call instance methods
