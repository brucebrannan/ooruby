#When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type.
#It defines what the class means, what an object of the class will
#consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object.

#A class definition starts with the keyword class followed by the class name
#and is delimited with an end

#Example:
#class Box
  #code
#end

#Use CamelCase for class names
